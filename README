Corsra is Italian for running, and run information is the main focus of Corsa. It stores GPS coordinates and timestamps and calculates distances between those coordinates. The coordinates are used in the frontend to vizualize the route on the users request.

Corsa is a WebSocket which connects to the Corsa-Frontend and recieves events which it reads, unpakcs and stores in a PostGreSQL database. It also sends out json objects back to the front with information. 

It also subscribes to a MQTT broker to recieve packages from a IoT device with GPS coordinates.
